# ZORAN Integrity Policy

1. All artifacts must be generated by CI using `zoran_trace.py`.
2. Releases require two independent approvers (one technical, one ethics/policy).
3. Root must be signed by at least two keys (KMS-protected or cosign OIDC).
4. Root must be anchored to Rekor (append-only log) before release.
5. A revocation procedure must be followed for any compromised key or artifact.
6. Auditor repo independent from publisher runs verification scripts.
